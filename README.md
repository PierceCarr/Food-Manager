Work in progress - futzing about partially for learning but planning on testing this out in a real kitchen. Using a create-react-app client and Express server. Using PostgreSQL for database, and making extensive use of the ORM Sequelize to manage it. Using Axios on the client for all the HTTPS that's neccessary. Haven't decided on session tech yet. Planning on using Heroku for hosting and SSL certificate.
