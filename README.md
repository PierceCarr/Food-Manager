--Server currently being re-hauled--

Work in progress - partially for learning but planning on testing this out in a real kitchen. Using a create-react-app client and Express server. Using PostgreSQL for the database, and making extensive use of the ORM Sequelize to manage it. Using Axios on the client for all the HTTPS that's neccessary. Likely going to use Auth0 for sessions. Planning on using Heroku for hosting and SSL certificate.
