Work in progress - futzing about partially for learning but planning on testing this out in a real kitchen. Using a create-react-app client and Express server. Should be using PostgreSQL for database, linking the server to it with Sequelize. Axios will let the client talk to the server using HTTPS. Haven't decided on session tech yet. Planning using Heroku for hosting and SSL certificate.
